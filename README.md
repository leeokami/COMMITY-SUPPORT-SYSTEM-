   ***my project is a Local Business Marketplace Subsystem, so I design this project is for help people can quickly learning local information about Marketplace, it is useful to user reduce energetic and cost in Covid-19 age, especially when economy is in the doldrums. At same time, the system can help user share their small business marketing and promotion events in the system.
    Because of mainly system is Community support system, most amount of user is Community Residents, so I decide choose Business model is C2C that people can display the “goods” information and comprehensive search and categorization of product/services are suppose in the website. 
      The subsystem about community support activity need able to help the customer Promoting their products the business model is C2C
